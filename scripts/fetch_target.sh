# The assignment requires building against a pinned commit, not upstream HEAD.
# This script makes that pin machine-checkable: it clones, checks out the SHA,
# and then re-reads the SHA back out of git to prove we got what we asked for.
# If upstream ever force-pushes or the SHA is mistyped, this fails loudly here
# instead of silently fuzzing the wrong code.

# Why this pin: v4.0.4 (2025-01-19) is the latest stable release. The only
# change to the parser (mxml-file.c) between this tag and upstream main as of
# 2026-03-21 is a copyright year and a moved #include -- zero functional
# difference. So any parser bug found here is also present in current main.
