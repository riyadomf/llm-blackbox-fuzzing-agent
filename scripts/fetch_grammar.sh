# Fetch the ANTLR XML grammar from antlr/grammars-v4 at a pinned commit.
#
# The assignment's first deliverable is "the grammar you used, its source, and
# any adaptations". Pinning the grammars-v4 commit makes the "its source" half
# precise: grammars-v4 is a living repo, and an unpinned fetch would leave the
# report describing a grammar that no longer matches the file on disk.
#
# Fetched by raw URL at the pinned SHA rather than by git clone: grammars-v4
# carries enough history that a clone takes minutes for two small files. The
# raw URL is SHA-addressed, so it is exactly as reproducible, and the checksums
# below make that machine-checked rather than assumed.
