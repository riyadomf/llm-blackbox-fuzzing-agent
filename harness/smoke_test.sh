# Step 2 requirement: demonstrate the harness behaves correctly on a handful of
# valid and invalid sample inputs before building anything on top of it.
#
# Written as assertions rather than a demo, so it can be re-run as a regression
# check. Every input in harness/samples/ has a declared expected exit code:
#
#   valid/*    -> 0  parsed cleanly
#   invalid/*  -> 1  rejected (a well-formed rejection, NOT a crash)
#   diag/*     -> 3  parsed, but the parser emitted a diagnostic
#
# The last of those is the important one. mxml can complain and still return a
# tree, so "the error callback fired" is not the same as "the input was
# rejected". If this case ever reports 1, the harness has regressed to
# classifying on diagnostics instead of on mxmlLoadString's return value, and
# the acceptance-rate signal the agentic loop steers by would be wrong.

# The single most important assertion here. Everything above proves the harness
# classifies non-crashing inputs correctly, but a build with the sanitizers
# silently absent would pass all of it and then report "no bugs found" forever.
#
# So: feed it a known real bug. Upstream issue #350 is a heap under-read in
# index_sort(), present in v4.0.4 and fixed only afterwards. The cause is
# unsigned arithmetic: templ/tempr are size_t, so when tempr reaches 0 the
# expression (tempr - 1) wraps to SIZE_MAX and the recursion indexes far out of
# bounds. Triggering it needs the first indexed node to sort strictly smallest,
# which is why <a><b/></a> crashes and <a><a/><a/></a> does not.
#
# Reached only via mxmlIndexNew, so the parse-only fuzzing runs never touch it.
# It exists purely as a positive control for crash detection and, later, for
# signature extraction and minimisation.
