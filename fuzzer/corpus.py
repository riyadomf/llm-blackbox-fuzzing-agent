"""Record and replay the exact inputs a campaign fed to the harness.

Recording the corpus means a run can be replayed without regenerating anything,
so replay does not depend on Hypothesis producing an identical draw sequence
across versions or environments.

Documents are stored as base64 of the bytes written to the harness's stdin, not
as text. Generated documents can contain raw-byte surrogateescape sentinels,
other lone surrogates, and embedded NULs, so a text round-trip could silently
alter what was tested.
