"""Minimise a crashing input using Hypothesis's shrinker, then verify it.

Steps 5.4 and 5.5:

  5.4 "use Hypothesis's shrinking (it runs automatically when a @given-wrapped
       test fails) ... If you're driving the harness outside of a @given test
       loop, make sure you're still invoking Hypothesis's shrinker rather than
       just keeping the first crashing example you saw."

  5.5 "Re-run each minimized reproducer once, standalone, against the pinned
       build to confirm it deterministically reproduces the crash."

The shrinker only runs when a @given test *fails*, so minimisation is not a
separate algorithm we implement: it is a consequence of letting the assertion
propagate. That is why `hunt` mode exists in fuzzer/campaign.py and why this
module raises rather than recording.

Verification re-runs the shrunk input N times as a fresh process. A reproducer
that fires only sometimes is worse than useless in a report, and the check is
cheap.
