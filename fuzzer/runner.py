"""Execute the harness against one generated input and classify what happened.

This module owns the crash/no-crash decision. Everything downstream depends on
it: the acceptance-rate signal, crash triage and the reported results.

Classification rules:

  * Killed by a signal  -> crash. SIGSEGV, SIGABRT, SIGFPE, SIGBUS all mean the
    process died rather than returning an answer.

  * Sanitizer text in stderr -> crash, even if the exit status looks benign.
    Belt and braces: the build sets -fno-sanitize-recover=all so UBSan aborts,
    but if that flag were ever lost, UBSan would print "runtime error:" and exit
    0, and a status-only check would silently record every UB finding as clean.

  * Timeout -> crash. The assignment is explicit: "Timeouts count as crashes for
    grading purposes. A parser that hangs instead of terminating is a real bug."
    Recorded as its own outcome so hangs stay distinguishable from memory bugs
    in triage.

  * Exit 1 -> a well-formed rejection, NOT a crash. A parser refusing malformed
    input is the parser working correctly.

  * Exit 3 -> parsed, but the parser emitted diagnostics. mxml complains and
    still returns a tree for some inputs (see grammar/ADAPTATIONS.md), so this
    is a genuine fourth state, not a variant of rejection.
