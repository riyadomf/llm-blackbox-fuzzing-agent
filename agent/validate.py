"""Validate an LLM-written strategy before spending the example budget on it.

A generator rejected almost every time by the parser's front door tests nothing,
so the strategy is checked before any example budget is spent on it.

Four gates, cheapest first, so a broken strategy fails fast:

  1. extract   pull the python block out of the response
  1b. truncated  reject a block whose head was lost in transport
  2. syntax    compile() it
  3. interface import it and draw sample documents
  4. smoke     run a small batch through the real harness and measure the
               acceptance rate

Gate 4 costs ~50 examples, a tenth of an iteration's budget, and catches the
rejected-at-the-front-door failure before 500 examples are spent on it. On
failure the loop issues one cheap repair call instead of burning an iteration.

Gates 3 and 4 run the generated code in a subprocess with a timeout, since a
generator with runaway recursion or an accidental infinite loop would otherwise
hang the run. This is containment against accident, not a security sandbox.

Gate 1b exists because `claude -p --output-format json` reports only the final
assistant message. When a response spans several messages the head of the module
is missing, and what arrives is a syntactically broken fragment of correct code.
Sending that back as a repair asks the model to fix something it did not get
wrong, so a truncated block is reported separately and the caller retries the
same prompt instead.
