#
#   seccomp=unconfined : AddressSanitizer maps a large fixed "shadow memory"
#     region at startup and calls personality() to reduce address-space
#     randomisation. Docker's default seccomp profile blocks that call, and
#     ASan then dies with "Shadow memory range interleaves with an existing
#     memory mapping" before main() ever runs.
#
#   cap-add SYS_PTRACE : lets the sanitizer's symbolizer read the process it
#     is reporting on, so crash reports carry function names instead of bare
#     hex addresses. Our crash signatures are built from function names, so
#     without this every crash would look identical.
#
#   ulimit stack=8388608 : pin the stack to the usual Linux 8 MiB. tomlc99
#     recurses without any depth limit, so "how deep can nesting go before it
#     crashes" is a direct function of stack size. Leaving it to the host's
#     default would make stack-overflow reproducers machine-dependent.

# Secrets come from .env, never from the image and never from the command line
# (a key on the command line lands in shell history and in `docker inspect`).
# Absent .env, replay mode still works, which is the point of the default.
#
# .env is NOT handed to --env-file directly. Docker's parser is stricter than a
# shell's: it does not strip surrounding quotes and does not understand an
# `export ` prefix, so OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-x" would arrive inside the container
# with the quote characters still attached and fail authentication in a way
# that looks like a bad key. Normalise into a private temp file instead.
